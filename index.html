        <h2>Welcome to 25M – The Vanguard of Tactical Excellence</h2>
        <p>25M is not just a military group; it's a force of nature. Born from a history of relentless dedication and tactical ingenuity, we are committed to defending our people and disrupting those who threaten our sovereignty. Our name, "25M," is a symbol of the date when we first rose to take action, the 25th of March—forever etched in our hearts as the day we vowed to fight for freedom, justice, and strength.</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Our goal is simple: <strong>to disrupt, dismantle, and destroy the defenses of our enemies</strong>. We specialize in infiltrating hostile lines, sowing chaos among our enemies, and leaving their military forces in disarray. Our operations are carried out with the utmost precision, ensuring that every strike counts. We do not wait for our enemies to make the first move—we are always one step ahead, taking the fight to them wherever they are.</p>

        <h3>Who We Fight</h3>
        <p>After recent developments, 25M no longer aligns with Greek interests and does not operate under their command. We fight for our own cause, focusing on any force that opposes our sovereignty, threatens our people, or attempts to challenge our power. Whether it be Skopjean forces, rogue militias, or organized military threats—if they stand in our way, they will be neutralized. Our campaign is not about politics; it's about strength, survival, and strategy.</p>

        <h3>Strength in Unity</h3>
        <p>At 25M, we are more than just soldiers; we are brothers and sisters in arms. Our strength lies in our unity, our shared commitment to the cause, and our unyielding loyalty to one another. Together, we face every challenge head-on, pushing through adversity with unwavering determination.</p>

        <h3>Join Us</h3>
        <p>The journey of 25M is just beginning. With every mission, every success, and every challenge, we grow stronger, smarter, and more capable. If you have the courage, the skill, and the heart to join us in our fight, we welcome you. The future of our nation rests in the hands of those who dare to lead, dare to fight, and dare to win.</p>
